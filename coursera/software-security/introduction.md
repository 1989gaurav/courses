Property of security:
* Confedentiality
* Intigrity
* Availability

How attackers compomise secrity:
* Vulnerability
* Defect
* Flaw

Aim:
* Prevent security related defects before deploying
* How to make vulnerabilities harder to exploit

Attack Categories:
* Buffer Overflows
* Dangling pointer dereferences

Different Attack Types:
* Spear phishing attacks
* Memory access
* Stack smashing
* SQL injection
* Cross site scripting(XSS)
* Clickjacking
* Session Hijacking
* Cross-site request forgery

Popular incidents and vulnerabilities:
* Heartbleed
* Shellshock
* Poodle

Some Guidelines:
* Ensure memory safety
* Input validations
* Damage containment

Security embedded Software Development Lifecycle:
* Requirements
** Identify assets and identify security requirement like confedentiality, availability and integrity.
** Threats and abuse cases which violates security requirements
* Desgin
** Apply principal of secure software design
** Favor simplicity
** Trust with reluctance
** Defence in depth
* Implementation
** Static analysis
** Symbolic execution
* Testing assurance
** Penetration testing
** Fuzz testing
